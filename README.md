# Workshop tutorial - Start to code

## Description

On behalf of the Arteveldehogeschool, we created a game for the @Work2 class to motivate external students to learn to code.

The idea was to give pupils or future students who have no prior knowledge of code an instructive but fun interactive introduction.

The project consists of a working game and a tutorial that explains everything step by step.

## Structure of the game

The app is built from the most straightforward structure a static website can have:

- index.html
- CSS
- JS

Basic JavaScript is used to make the game functional.
